Run TypeScript type checking on the whatsapp-bridge without emitting output.

Run from the whatsapp-bridge directory:
```
npx tsc --noEmit
```

If there are type errors:
1. Read each failing file
2. Explain what's wrong in plain language
3. Suggest or apply the fix
4. Re-run the type check to confirm
