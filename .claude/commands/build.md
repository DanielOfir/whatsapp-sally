Build the whatsapp-bridge TypeScript project.

Run `npm run build` from the whatsapp-bridge directory. This compiles TypeScript from `src/` into `dist/`.

If the build fails:
1. Read the error output carefully — TypeScript errors include file paths and line numbers
2. Open the failing file(s) and fix the type errors
3. Re-run the build to verify the fix
4. Report what was wrong and what you fixed
